# Learn React Native Gestures and Animations

Materials from the declarative gestures and animations workshop for freeCodeCamp.

## Install

```
$ yarn install
```

## Run

```
$ yarn start
```

## Code Along

Each example contains the full source code as well as the boilerplate files in case you want to code along with the video.
In the transitions lessons, for instance, the code is available in `src/Transitions`. To use the boilerplate, go to `src/Transitions/index.ts` and replace

```tsx
export { default } from "./TransitionsFinal";
```

with

```tsx
export { default } from "./Transitions";
```
